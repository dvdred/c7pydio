----
Pydio 6.4.0 is a stable release introducing many important new features!

Installation is done via the "Stable" update channel in-app.
Noticeable changes

Sharing Deeply Reworked
 * Ability to now share files with other users (without creating necessarily a public link)
 * Ability to toggle the visibility of a share inside a common workspace, to let other users edit this share
 * Implementation of the Federated Sharing API to allow sharing files and folders accross Pydio instances, and with other software providers implementing this API (currently OwnCloud).
 * Rework of the share panel, with direct-click for copy, better expiration date visualisation, and many more
UI transitioning smoothly to Material Design and ReactJS: following our previous work on the Enterprise Distribution with Material Design guidelines, and listening to your feedback about the UI. Changes are subtle (no big reorganization), but interface should be really clearer.
Mails Digest : avoid receiving tons of emails when watching for a file or folder modification, and opt-in for an hourly/daily/weekly based digest instead.
CacheService mechanism : extension of our previous work with in-memory cache to support many types of key-value stores (apc, memcache, reddis, etc..). We are using the well-established Doctrine Cache component.
WebDAV access driver was entirely rewritten using Guzzle
Amazon S3 Access Driver: improved, we now support PHP-SDK v2 and v3. Hook to our Cache Service for better performances.

---------------

Pydio 6.3.1 is a development release introducing many important new features! As its name implies, it is NOT production-ready yet. However, the more you help us testing and you report issues, the quicker we will be able to transform it into a stable 6.4.

Please use Github to submit issues, making as sure as possible to submit only issues linked to this new release : regression of existing features, or problems with the new ones. Enjoy!
It's also a good time to help on translations with the new strings! Thanks for all your contributions.

Installation is done via the "Development" update channel in-app. They will not be any Linux Packages released for that version.
Noticeable changes

Sharing Deeply Reworked:
Ability to now share files with other users (without creating necessarily a public link)
Ability to toggle the visibility of a share inside a common workspace, to let other users edit this share
Implementation of the Federated Sharing API to allow sharing files and folders accross Pydio instances, and with other software providers implementing this API (currently OwnCloud).
Rework of the share panel, with direct-click for copy, better expiration date visualisation, and many more
UI transitioning smoothly to Material Design and ReactJS: following our previous work on the Enterprise Distribution with Material Design guidelines, and listening to your feedback about the UI. Changes are subtle (no big reorganization), but interface should be really clearer.
Mails Digest : avoid receiving tons of emails when watching for a file or folder modification, and opt-in for an hourly/daily/weekly based digest instead.

Known Issues

Again, it's a dev release. There are some limitations that you should be aware of.
Internet Explorer Limited support : IE11/Edge should go pretty well, others, mmm, not sure :-)

[Summary]

Pydio 6.2.0 brings massive performance improvements, many bug fixes from previous version, and a couple of new features:
 * Performances: we gained an average 5 times in performance on every request. Using optional in-memory KeyValue Caching adds a tremendous improvement for Rest calls (sync).
 * Tar gz / bz2 support: creation and extraction of archives
 * Web UI: Better mobile support. Under the hood, we started migrating our whole JS platform from legacy libraries to Ecma Script 6. We now use Grunt tasks to compile/minify the JS
 * Packaging: Rework of our Linux packages from ground up, splitting plugins into separate packages, with packaging best-practice in mind.
 * PHP7-Ready: we chased language issues that could compatibility problems with PHP7.
 * And many many bug fixed on all parts of the application, see Changelog below.

Contributors: cdujeu, svetlemodry, rimckenney, c12simple, Isma91, leobouilloux, huzergackl, DepaMarco, ecappa, sespivak, Uggy, sim1st. Thanks to all for making this happen!

[Upgrade notes: please read]

. This new version now requires a php version greater or equal to 5.4. We also dropped support for IE7. Yes we did. Make sure that you meet these requirements before upgrading!
. If you are using the meta.mount plugin, we removed entirely the "sudo" options for security reasons. If you were relying on that, you will have to hack-it-yourself.
. The ROOT_ROLE was replaced by a "Root Group" role concept: a role corresponding to the root of all groups, and as such applied automatically to every users.

For archive deployments, upgrade should be straightforward, but for Linux make sure to check our online How-To.

## Core & Performances
Core performances: . AJXP_Controller: Minimize xPath calls by implementating a hookCache . AJXP_Plugin: reduce serialization - AJXP_PluginService: Try to use cache for softLoad operation (still return a cloned version of the cached plugin) . AJXP_Utils: cache the result of cleanDibiDriverParameters() function as it is called many times. (details)
Fix OS detection - Add iPad & iPhone (details)
RunTests: Fix apiPost function() (details)
If a client is posting bad parameters, it can end up copying a file into itself. (details)
Revert the automatic switch to MySQLi, add a parameter instead. (details)
Perfs: avoid reapplying role if already in the user's roles. (details)
Hard reload node data with clearstatcache() call on node update Add a seed with file modiftime to make sure thumbnail is reloaded on change (details)
Fix comparison issue for AJXP_METADATA_ALLUSERS value. Could lead to share metadata. (details)
Typo in mailer, fix #864 (details)
Fix various issues with Forget Password action - Fix #863 (details)
Prevent some plugins to be disabled - Close #873 (details)
Add utils in node for moving meta on node change (details)

Use protocol in runTests script - Fix #871 (details)

Switch TRANSMIT_CLEAR_PASS to hidden parameter (don't remove it totally for backward compatibility) - Close #875 (details)
Add a getOptionAsBool() function abstractAuthDriver and use everywhere we use TRANSMIT_CLEAR_PASS. Handle all possible values (true, "true", 1, etc...). (details)
Plugin : load global_param and param configs definitions (details)

Move decypher function in AJXP_Utils instead of AbstractAjxpUser. Do not override __AJXP_VALUE_SET__ when parsing standard form. New parameter $complexChars in generateRandomString function. (details)
Unused decodeUserPassword method (use AJXP_Utils instead). (details)
Use AJXP_Utils function for decyphering password (details)
Make sure not to use the repositories cache if not yet initialized. (details)
Meta.quota: make sure to respect hierarchy by trying to get quota of parent repository owner if it exists (can be a template child without owner), then from the currently logged user, then from the repository config. Fix #884 (details)
Hunting while(!feof(..)) calls missing a test on the resource: can trigger an infinite read and a CPU hog. (details)
Default "Cache Master Users" parameter to False instead of True (details)
Remove meta_fields, meta_types, meta_labels from node metadata, use exposed plugins configs instead. Fix CSS labels on detailed view. (details)

Login: empty the fields values only after response is received. (details)
Pass session credentials to command line via ENV variable. Generate a unique secret key at install for tokenisation of CLI calls instead of using default one. (details)
